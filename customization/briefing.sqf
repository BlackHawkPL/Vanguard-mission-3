NEWTAB("I. Situation:")
1.a.) Civilian Overview:
<br/>
The pre-dawn raids and the assault onto OBJ Rifles have sent the civilian population fleeing north or hiding inside houses.
<br/>
There should be zero civilian presence on the battlefield.
ENDTAB;

NEWTAB("A. Enemy Forces:")
1.b.) Enemy Forces overview. The 101st MIBN established a final defensive
position on OBJ Pistol with a mechanized Infantry Platoon (+).<br/>
<br/>
1.b.1.) Composition, Disposition and Strength. Our Battalion will likely come
into contact with the defensive forces on OBJ Pistol after Attack Company cross
the 14 Northing. The majority of their forces will be occupying well-established
defensive formation inside the city and manning static crew served ATGM/MG
system. A few of their forces are expected to man observation posts in the
surrounding hills to the East, North, & West of the OBJ. The enemy has access
to 2 x 60mm. The enemy’s BMP Platoon was still guarding interior supply lines
due to B/1-18’s raid; however, they were spotted moving towards OBJ Pistol to
reinforce enemy forces there. ETA is between 5-15 minutes out.<br/>
<br/>
1.b.2.) Most Probable Course of Action. The enemy will engage friendly M2A2s
with ATGM systems to destroy or immobilize them in between the 14 and 15
Northing. With the loss our M2A2 assisting our maneuver, dismounted infantry
will be slow to cross the field onto the OBJ and more likely to be suppressed by
their MG systems and destroyed by their mortar system.<br/>
<br/>
1.b.3.) Most Dangerous Course of Action. No change to above except enemy
BMP will counter-attack and pursue A/1-18 as we displace back to the BN TAA.<br/>
<br/>
1.b.4.) Forms of Contact:<br/>
<br/>
OBSERVATION. Enemy elements in the OPs will have limited optics aside from
what is provided by their ATGM systems and personal binoculars.<br/>
<br/>
INDIRECT. 1 The MIC has 1 x 60mm mortar section (4.5km) providing support
to the their forward elements.<br/>
<br/>
DIRECT. The PLT will have BMP-3 that will have thermals and will be able to
engage friendly forces out to (3km). Static ATGM systems consist of *** and
crew served 12.7mm with effective range of 1km. Individual small arms will
consist of AK-47, PKM, RPG-7.<br/>
<br/>
OBSTACLES. During their assault onto OBJ Rifles, D/1-18 reported seeing
individuals placing mines 200-300 south of OBJ Pistol. They also reported 3-4x,
100-m sections of triple strand concertina wire to the south of OBJ Pistol as
well.<br/>
CHEMICAL. None.<br/>
AIR. None.<br/>
ENDTAB;

NEWTAB("B. Friendly Forces:")
1.c. Friendly<br/>
<br/>
1.c.1.) BN Mission. 0630 1-18 IN assaults to seize OBJ Pistol in order to secure the
town of Charkia and enable freedom of maneuver to follow-on Brigade forces.<br/>
<br/>
1.c.2.) Concept of Main Effort Mission. The decisive point of this main effort assault
is securing OBJ Pistol in order to enable freedom of maneuver for follow-on
Brigade forces.. The Battalion will accomplish this by maintaining D/1-18 IN at SBF
Dog with fires oriented to the North/North-East in order to provide freedom of
maneuver for Attack Company. On Order, Attack Company will SP from ATK POS
Attack and secure OBJ Pistol. BN Mortars will provide IDF support for the duration
of the Assault.<br/>
<br/>
1.c.3.) Adjacent Units. Battalion Mortars are currently located at mortar firing
position (MFP) 1 and under the control of Attack 6. D/1-18 IN is located at SBF Dog.
A section from SCTS/1-18 or 1/C/1-18 (“Green 1”) will fall under command of
Attack 6. All other Battalion forces are at AA Vanguard.<br/>
ENDTAB;

NEWTAB("C. General Notes:")
General Notes:<br/>
<br/>
- Dog Company’s presence is notional. However, there will be barriers to prevent
the enemy forces from entering areas that D/1-18 could potentially engage them.<br/>
<br/>
- Depending on the outcome of the previous mission, Attack 6 will have command
of either an 1 x HMMWV scout section or an 1 x M1A2 section.<br/>
<br/>
- Enemy infantry were spotted hastily laying AT mines south of the town of
Charkia. These are not notional. The number of mines is a direct result of the
outcome of mission 1.
<br/>
- The weather today is clear and wind is minimal.
ENDTAB;

NEWTAB("II. Mission:")
2. Company Mission: Attack Company assaults to seize OBJ Pistol NLT 0830 in
order to destroy the enemy force defending OBJ Pistol and provide freedom of
maneuver to follow-on Brigade forces.
ENDTAB;

NEWTAB("III. Execution:")
As per CO intent.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>There is a capture zone in the center of town that you must take and hold for ten minutes (the GM will have to end the mission).

NEWTAB("I. Situation:")
1.a.) Civilian Overview:<br/>
The pre-dawn raids and the assault onto BP Alpha have sent the civilian population fleeing north or hiding inside houses.
<br/>There should be zero civilian presence on the battlefield.
ENDTAB;

NEWTAB("A. Enemy Forces:")
1.b.) Enemy Forces overview. An enemy armor company has a cross the
international boundary and forced Alpha Company to displace from their battle
position. An enemy mechanized infantry company was observed training the
lead tank company and is likely to attack BP Charlie.<br/>
<br/>
1.b.1.) Composition, Disposition and Strength. We expect to defend against a
M2A2 Mechanized Infantry Company minus. They are also equipped with a 
60mm mortar section. It is possible that they will be reinforced with a HMMWV or tank
section from another element as well.<br/>
<br/>
1.b.2.) Most Probable Course of Action. Enemy will attempt destroy our
emplaced ATGM systems that over-watch the engagement with indirect fire.
After our ATGM capabilities are sufficiently reduced, they will attack with the
attack the city with dismounted infantry supported by direct fires from their
M2A2s.<br/>
<br/>
1.b.4.) Forms of Contact:<br/>
<br/>
OBSERVATION. Enemy forces will possess high-powered thermal optics mounted on their vehicles while the infantry will carry personal binoculars.<br/>
<br/>
INDIRECT. 1 The enemy has 1 x 60mm mortar section (4.5km) providing
support to the their forward elements.<br/>
<br/>
DIRECT. The PLT will have M2A2 that will have thermals and will be able to
engage friendly forces out to (2km). Individual small arms will consist of M4,
M249, M240, and AT-4 systems.<br/>
<br/>
OBSTACLES. None.<br/>

NEWTAB("B. Friendly Forces:")
1.c. Friendly:<br/>
<br/>
1.c.1.) 101 Mechanized Infantry Battalion (MIBN) Mission. Our mission has
changed with the enemy’s attack on our supply depots last night. Immediately
after the raid, the 101st MIBN reacted quickly by establishing forward
observers on international boundary. We are pushing the remaining ammo
and mines to the forward units. A/101 is displaced North off of BP Alpha and
are continuing to engage enemy armor forces. C/101 is split between guard
duty around AO Boris and BP Charlie. B/101 is continuing to defend AO Boris
and assist with resupply efforts.<br/>
<br/>
1.c.2.) Concept of A/101 MIBN Defense Mission. The decisive point of this
mission is the successful channeling of enemy forces into our engagement
zone where we can mass both direct and indirect fire to destroy them. The
destruction of their M2A2 by our ATGM systems will slow the rate of their
infantry’s maneuver allowing us to effectively employ indirect fires.<br/>
<br/>
1.c.3. Adjacent Units: All friendly units have displaced to the North of BP
Charlie.

NEWTAB("III. Execution:")
<br/>Notes on Execution:
<br/>- You will observe Geneva conventions and refrain from engaging the MEDEVAC M113. However, M113 must not be used for transportation of non-wounded or it loses Geneva protections.
<br/>
<br/>There is a capture zone in the center of town that you must hold. If the enemy holds the zone for ten minutes they win (the GM will have to end the mission).
